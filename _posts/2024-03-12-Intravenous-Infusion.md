## Kidney 
So, today I had to go to the infusion center and receive some intravenous drugs to prevent rejection of the kidney.  It went pretty smooth with no issues.  I will need to do this probably 2 more times, my next infusion being March 26th.  Today was my first day back in the office, and I was a little worried about being winded, but it worked out ok.  I think that a key might be to eat breakfast.  I think the drugs I have to take in the morning probably should not be taken on an empty stomach.  I had something to eat today and had no tiredness or dizziness.  Routines must change.

## This site
I will be adding more content and pictures to the site as a way of sharing things, but it will be slow going.  I would love it if you could add some comments once I implement them, so that I can tell if things are working.  I'll have that working in a day or two.

And I will throw some pictures up of Karl and Sammy. 

Thanks for your support
