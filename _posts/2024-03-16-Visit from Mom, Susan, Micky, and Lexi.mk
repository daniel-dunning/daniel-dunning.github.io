# Nice visit from family
It was a nice surpise to have Mom, Susan, Micky and Lexi come down on the train to visit with me on Thursday.  I knew that a trip was planned but was certain that it would happen later in the month when the Cherry Blossoms were in full bloom.  But they arrived on Friday and it was wonderful to connect with everyone.    We hung out a little bit on Friday and endded up having dinner at Outback which was close to where they were staying.

## Friday
I had to work on Friday, and the Thomas' had arrangeed to visit the African American Museum downtown ( https://nmaahc.si.edu/ ).   I hope to get some pictures from them to post and will implement the comment sections so that they can add some information about what they saw, but from what I understand it was quite interesting and well worth the trip.  As is the case in all Smithsonian Museums, one day is simply not enough to see everything.

Once thery returned, Mom and Susan came over to my apartment where Susan made me a pot of chili.  I always ask her to do this for me as it is delicious and I can get so many meals out of it, and saves me so much time preparing for dinner.   While she cooked (and cleaned -- thank you Susan), Mom and I and Karl watched the Uconn / St. Johns game.  That was an exciting matchup which fortunately UCONN was able to pull out.

For dinner, we went to a local restaurant called the Sweetwater Tavern in Sterling.  It was really nice and I think everyone enjoyed themselves.

## Saturday
THe train back to New Jersey was leaving at 3pm, so we headed over to the Amphora Deluxe Diner ( https://amphoragroup.com/amphoras-diner-deluxe/ ), which was very good.  We had a short phone conversation with Jake which was also nice, as he was getting his day started in Indiana.  After breakfast, everyone loaded up and headed back to New Jersey, but not before we were able to get a couple of pictures taken.
